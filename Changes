    * API change to xtract_attrs and shadowed_attrs
    * passing container class to shadowed_attrs is now optional if
      it is called from that class.

    * after the first call to shadowable_attrs(), it will return the
      attributes which may be shadowed.

    * new routine shadowed_attrs(), returns the attributes actually
      shadowed in a container.  can be used to easily delegate
      attributes to the contained class.
